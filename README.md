# Sales & Customer Analytics Project

## Overview

This project focuses on uncovering insights related to sales performance, customer demographics, and product inventory. Using Python, the dataset was cleaned, explored, and analysed to support strategic decision-making around sales optimisation, customer retention, and operational efficiency. A full technical analysis is provided in the Jupyter Notebook, with key insights summarised in the accompanying PDF report.

## Audience

This project is intended for the company's executive leadership, sales directors, product managers, and operations teams who require evidence-based insights to support strategic and operational decision-making.

## Project Purpose

The company has shown inconsistent sales performance across regions and product classes, alongside rising cost pressures and uneven warehouse workloads. Leadership needs a clear understanding of why these performance gaps exist and where to focus improvement efforts.

This analysis answers key strategic business questions:

* Why does Sydney generate high revenue but low transaction value?

* Why does Australia outperform New Zealand in average transaction value?

* Which customer groups and product types contribute most to cost and operational strain?

* What factors most strongly influence sales and cost outcomes?

* Where should company prioritise effort to improve growth, profitability, and operational efficiency?

The purpose of this project is to deliver clear insights, validated patterns, and data-backed recommendations that support smarter sales strategy, optimised product mix decisions, and improved operational performance across the business.

## Why This Analysis Matters?

Understanding sales drivers and cost behaviour enables the company to:

* allocate inventory and staffing more efficiently

* set region-specific growth and performance strategies

* optimise product mix for margin expansion

* reduce cost pressure from unprofitable customer segments

* increase transaction value in major cities

* improve NZ market performance through product realignment

This project directly supports sales strategy, customer retention, pricing decisions, and operational planning, ensuring LuminaTech can respond to performance gaps with evidence-based actions.

## Deliverables

This repository includes:

* notebook.ipynb – Analytical Jupyter Notebook
Full data cleaning, EDA, statistical tests, and regression modelling.

* report.pdf – Executive Business Report
Summarised insights, visualisations, and strategic recommendations aligned to company’s needs.

## Approach

This project uses a decision-focused analytics workflow:

1. Business Understanding

Define performance issues across regions, customer types, product lines, and warehouse operations.

2. Data Preparation and EDA

Clean and transform multi-year sales and operational data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

3. Performance Validation

Use descriptive analytics and statistical testing to confirm performance differences.

4. Driver Analysis

Apply regression models to isolate the strongest predictors of sales value and cost-to-serve.

5. Insight Translation

Convert analytical results into commercial insights.

6. Strategic Recommendations

Develop targeted, actionable strategies to improve margin, revenue, and operational efficiency.

## Key Insights (Summary)

Sydney & Melbourne produce high revenue via volume but have the lowest transaction value → strong upsell/bundling opportunity.

AU outperforms NZ due to better product mix (higher contribution classes).

Traditional lighting dominates (67%), limiting growth; LED & Accessories remain underleveraged.

Professional customer group contributes significantly higher fulfilment costs.

Warehouse 5N2 (Minto) faces disproportionate workload from low-value orders.

## Strategic Recommendations (Summary)

Introduce bundling, LED upgrades, and accessory cross-sells in major cities.

Shift NZ focus away from discounted classes and toward higher-margin items.

Review Professional group pricing/discount structure to reduce cost pressure.

Balance warehouse loads and streamline small-order fulfilment.

Align seasonal marketing, staffing, and inventory with peak/low demand cycles.
